# Customer-segmentation


This code performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on customer transaction data to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. The RFM analysis involves:

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and standardizing the data.
Calculating RFM metrics for each customer.

Clustering:
Using KMeans clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct clusters.
Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

Interpretation:
Assigning meaningful labels to each cluster based on RFM values.
Visualizing the distribution of customers across different segments.

Results:
Three main customer segments identified: Whales (high-value customers), Lapsed Customers (low-engagement customers), and Average Customers.
Provides insights into customer behavior and allows for targeted marketing strategies.
